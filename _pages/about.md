# About Me

Hi! I'm **Zhiyuan Liu**, a senior undergraduate student at the **School of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University**.  
My research interests lie in **machine learning** and **generative models**, especially **diffusion models** and their applications in visual generation and federated learning.  

I enjoy exploring how diffusion-based methods can bridge data-driven creativity and real-world deployment.
